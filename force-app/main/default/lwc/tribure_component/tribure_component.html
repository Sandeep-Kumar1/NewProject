                Missile Man Of India
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who 
                served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in 
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four 
                decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development 
                Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in 
                India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be 
                known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
                vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political
                role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by 
                India in 1974.
                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya 
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's 
                President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a 
                single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's 
                highest civilian honour.
